It will create a new Docker container with the specified docker image
docker create --name<container name> <image name>

to start a stopped or new container, we use
docker start <container name>

Docker run command will do the work of both "docker create" and "docker start"
docker run --name <container name> <image name>

If we want to pause the processes running inside the container, we use:
docker pause <container name>

To unpause the container:
docker unpause ,conatiner name>

Stop container - to all the processes running in that container. Stopping does not mean killing or ending the processes
docker stop <container name>

If a container is stopped, all its allocated resources are released
If a container is paused, all its allocated resources(memory, cpu) are not released.

To kill a conatiner:
docker kill <container name> - Immediate termination

To delete a container:
docker rm <container name>
To delete a container, we have to first stop the container

docker run --name mongodb-container mongo

To build local image
docker build -t <image-name> .

to run this image
docker run -d --name <container-name> -p 3000:3000 <image-name>

with docker compose
docker-compose up --build - this command will build the image and then run it inside the container
